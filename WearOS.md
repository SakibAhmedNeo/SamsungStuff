Health Service on Wear OS

Health is one factor of life that every person is concerned about. Unfortunately, most people do not have a firm grasp on all the aspects of health. One of the biggest reasons for this is being unable to check and monitor your health on the fly. Back in the day, you would usually need medical tools or even a medical practitioner to know about your body. The introduction of new technologies enabled the average person to monitor their body whenever they want and thus allowing them to have control over their lifestyle as well. One of the most recent contributors to this cause is Health Services on Wear OS. In this blog article, I will talk about this service, the benefits that come from it, and why this is the future of wearable health services. 

What is Wear OS?

You might wonder what Wear OS is, in short, it is an operating system built by Google for smartwatches. This system allows you to bring your app from an userâ€™s palm to their wrists; meaning your apps can now be run on their smartwatches. Wear OS has allowed people to be on the go and use certain features of a phone without having to take it out. Since it is based on android and is optimized for the wrists it enables an user to receive incoming notifications, make and receive calls, and many more tasks. One of the prevalent uses of Wear OS is in the health and fitness realm. 

Introducing Health Services

This type of technology has allowed a person mid workout to monitor their heart rate, step count, calories, distance, etc, removing the nuisance of using a phone continuously throughout the workout. To take advantage of this market Google and Samsung have teamed up to bring out Wear OS 3 which includes a new component called Health Services. This interface allows a developer to create apps with numerous sensors and algorithms with ease. Before this service, one had to manually connect and configure each sensor that they wanted to use, collect the desired sensor data and in the end they had to create their own algorithms to make sense and utilize the data received from the sensors, and convert them into metrics that can be understood by the general public or further use those metrics to find more variables. With Health services a bridge is created which allows developers to make use of dynamic algorithms present in the platform while making sure that there is consistent data across apps. Developers can attain all the data for their own apps directly from the Health Services without any kind of inconveniences.

Advantages of Health Services

The benefits that come from this service would make any developer want to build a health and fitness app for wearable devices. 
One of the bigger concerns for any app developer is efficient usage of battery, without this service you would have to manually find ways and optimize power consumption but Health Services allows a developer to conserve battery without even having to think about it. Health services use certain configurations of the sensor to optimize how the battery is consumed.
The Service is loaded with a ton of robust algorithms that developers can make use of. 
Data is kept reliable and consistent in all apps as the base computations of the platform are standardized. For the same reason an app will always be kept up to date very easily.
All the features provided by the Wear OS 3 Health Services allows developers to concentrate more on user experiences and creating attributes that make their app stand out. They do not have to worry about getting the desired metrics as they are automatically provided.

How to get started with Wear OS and Health Services?

Google has set up a relatively documentation which can be found in the following link: https://developer.android.com/training/wearables. Further details on Health services can be found in the link: https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/health-services. These documentations show you how to set up these features from scratch with relative ease.
